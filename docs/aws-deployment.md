# AWS Deployment (Phase 1) — Cost-Effective Launch on us-east-2

This document describes the Phase 1 AWS architecture for Portfolio Desk,
sized for **5 tenant organizations at launch, scaling to ~20 within 6–12
months**, in **us-east-2**, with **no data-residency/compliance
constraints**. It intentionally optimizes for the lowest viable cost first
("cheapest viable, scale later") rather than day-one high availability.

`main` remains the development branch and keeps deploying to the existing
VPS/Portainer host via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (unchanged). A new
`prod` branch is the AWS deployment target — merge/promote to `prod` to ship
to AWS.

## Architecture

         RDS Postgres 16                    S3 (uploads bucket)
         db.t4g.micro, single-AZ            STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
                                    S3 (backups bucket, pg_dump + tar)
```

- **Compute**: a single EC2 `t4g.small` (ARM/Graviton, ~20% cheaper than the
  x86 `t3` equivalent) runs the same `docker compose` stack as today, minus
  the `db` container.
- **Database**: Postgres moves off the EC2 host onto RDS
  (`db.t4g.micro`, single-AZ, gp3 storage with autoscaling up to 100 GB).
  `POSTGRES_HOST`/`POSTGRES_PORT` are already externalized in
  `backend/app/config.py`, so this required no backend code changes.
- **File storage**: uploaded attachments move from the local `uploads` Docker
  volume to S3 via a new pluggable storage backend
  (`backend/app/utils/file_storage.py`, `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`). This removes
  the single biggest blocker to running more than one backend
  instance/AZ in a later phase.
- **Secrets**: DB password, JWT secret, Stripe/Gemini keys, etc. live in a
  single AWS Secrets Manager secret (`infra/terraform/aws/secrets.tf`); the
  EC2 instance role has read-only access to it.
- **Backups**: the existing nightly `pg_dump` + `uploads` tar script
  (`docs/backup-setup.md`) continues to run from the EC2 host into the new
  Terraform-managed `*-backups` S3 bucket; RDS automated snapshots
  (7-day retention) provide a second, independent recovery point.
- **TLS/DNS**: for Phase 1, terminate TLS with Nginx + Let's Encrypt (or a
  CloudFront distribution once static assets move off nginx in Phase 2) and
  point Route 53 at the EC2 instance's Elastic IP.

## Why this is the cheapest viable setup

- Single small EC2 host instead of ECS/Fargate — no per-task overhead while
  tenant count is 5–20.
- RDS single-AZ `db.t4g.micro` instead of Multi-AZ — acceptable downtime risk
  at this scale; Multi-AZ is a single Terraform flag away when it isn't
  (`db_multi_az` in `variables.tf`).
- Graviton (`t4g`) instance families throughout for ~20% savings over `t3`/`m5`.
- No NAT gateway or private-subnet cost: Phase 1 deploys into the account's
  existing default VPC (see `infra/terraform/aws/network.tf`).
- S3 is pay-per-GB with no idle cost, versus provisioning EBS/EFS capacity
  up front.

## Growth path (Phase 2, not yet provisioned)

When tenant count or traffic outgrows a single EC2 host:
1. Move the backend to ECS Fargate (2+ tasks) behind an ALB — safe today
   because `app/tasks/scheduler.py` already guards every cron job with a
   Postgres advisory lock, so multiple replicas cannot double-run a job.
2. Flip `db_multi_az = true` and consider a read replica for reporting/AI
   "data query" workloads.
3. Move the three SPAs (`frontend`, `admin-frontend`, `landing`) to
   CloudFront + S3 static hosting instead of nginx containers.
4. Add CloudWatch alarms on ALB 5xx rate, RDS CPU/connections, and ECS task
   health; centralize container logs to CloudWatch Logs.

## Terraform

Infrastructure-as-code lives in `infra/terraform/aws/`:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `versions.tf` | Provider/version pins, default tags |
| `variables.tf` | All configurable inputs (region, instance sizes, secrets) |
| `network.tf` | Default-VPC/subnet lookup, ARM AMI lookup |
| `ec2.tf` | App instance, security group, IAM role/instance profile |
| `rds.tf` | RDS Postgres instance, subnet group, security group |
| `s3.tf` | Uploads bucket + backups bucket (versioned, encrypted, lifecycle rules) |
| `ecr.tf` | Private ECR repos (namespace `office-manager/*`) for the app images + `ecr-push` IAM policy for the build runner |
| `secrets.tf` | Single Secrets Manager secret with all app credentials |
| `templates/user_data.sh.tpl` | EC2 boot script: installs Docker, registers the box as a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner |
| `outputs.tf` | RDS endpoint, S3 bucket names, instance id/IP, secret ARN |

State is **remote** (S3 + DynamoDB lock table), configured via the partial
`backend "s3" {}` block in `versions.tf`. This is required, not just
recommended: `infra-prod.yml` runs `terraform apply` on an ephemeral
GitHub-hosted runner, so local state would be thrown away after every run
and the next run would try to re-create every resource, failing with
"already exists"/"Duplicate" errors from AWS.

### One-time: bootstrap the state backend

Before the first `terraform init` in `infra/terraform/aws`, create the S3
bucket + DynamoDB lock table it stores state in, using the separate
`infra/terraform/bootstrap` module (this module keeps local state itself —
it's the one piece of infra that has to exist before remote state can):

```bash
cd infra/terraform/bootstrap
terraform init
terraform apply -var="state_bucket_name=office-manager-tfstate-<your-account-id>"
terraform output   # note state_bucket / lock_table for the next step
```

### Bootstrapping `infra/terraform/aws`

```bash
cd infra/terraform/aws
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # fill in non-secret values
cp backend.hcl.example backend.hcl             # fill in the bucket/table from the step above
# Provide secrets via environment variables so they are never written to disk:
export TF_VAR_db_password=...
export TF_VAR_jwt_secret=...
export TF_VAR_default_admin_password=...
export TF_VAR_github_runner_pat=...            # GitHub PAT, repo scope, used once at boot
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

In CI, the bucket/table names are supplied via the (non-secret) repository
variables `TF_STATE_BUCKET`, `TF_STATE_LOCK_TABLE`, and optionally
`TF_STATE_REGION` (defaults to `us-east-2`) — see
`.github/workflows/infra-prod.yml`. The state file `key` is fixed to
`aws/prod/terraform.tfstate` in both the workflow and
`backend.hcl.example`; keep them in sync if you ever change it (e.g. to add
a second environment).

### Recovering from "already exists" errors after a state-less apply

`infra-prod.yml`'s `infra` job runs a "Self-heal Terraform state" step before
every `plan`/`apply` that automatically imports any of the resources below
that AWS already has but the state file doesn't track yet (restoring the
Secrets Manager secret from "scheduled for deletion" first if needed), so
this is normally handled without manual intervention. The steps below are
for running the same recovery by hand — e.g. locally, or if the self-heal
step can't reach AWS (missing/expired credentials) — such as when
`terraform apply` previously ran without a remote backend (e.g. before this
change) and partially succeeded, leaving real resources in AWS with no state
file tracking them. Re-running `terraform apply` after configuring the
remote backend above will *not* fix this by itself — import each
pre-existing resource into the new remote state once, then re-run
`terraform plan` to confirm no further changes are proposed:

```bash
cd infra/terraform/aws
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl

terraform import aws_iam_role.app office-manager-prod-app
terraform import aws_db_subnet_group.this office-manager-prod
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.uploads office-manager-prod-uploads
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.backups office-manager-prod-backups

# If the secret was previously destroyed, it sits in a "scheduled for
# deletion" state for its recovery window (30 days by default) and *cannot*
# be created or imported until it's restored — you'll otherwise see
# "InvalidRequestException: You can't create this secret because a secret
# with this name is already scheduled for deletion":
aws secretsmanager restore-secret --secret-id office-manager/prod/app-secrets
terraform import aws_secretsmanager_secret.app office-manager/prod/app-secrets

# Security group ids aren't guessable from the name; look them up first:
aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
  --filters Name=group-name,Values=office-manager-prod-app,office-manager-prod-db \
  --query 'SecurityGroups[].{Name:GroupName,Id:GroupId}'
terraform import aws_security_group.app <sg-id-for-office-manager-prod-app>
terraform import aws_security_group.db  <sg-id-for-office-manager-prod-db>

terraform plan   # should show no create/replace for the imported resources
```

If `aws_db_instance.this` also failed with `InvalidParameterValue: The
input isn't valid. Input can't contain control characters`, it's almost
always a `TF_VAR_db_password` secret with a stray embedded/trailing
character (e.g. a newline picked up when the value was copied from a file
or piped in). `rds.tf`/`secrets.tf` already `trimspace()` the password and
`variables.tf` validates it against `^[^\x00-\x1f\x7f]*$` before it reaches
AWS — if you still hit this error, the plan that was applied (`tfplan`) was
generated *before* that validation/secret value was fixed (e.g. from a
stale run or an out-of-date `TF_VAR_DB_PASSWORD`). Re-check the secret
value for control characters and re-run `terraform plan`/`apply` from
scratch so the current value is re-validated rather than re-applying an old
`tfplan` artifact.

## CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

One workflow targets the `prod` branch; `main`'s existing `deploy.yml`
(VPS/Portainer) is untouched:

- **`.github/workflows/infra-prod.yml`** — a single, end-to-end pipeline for
  the `prod` branch that validates the AWS infra is in place, builds the
  container images, and deploys them onto the AWS resources. It runs on every
  push to `prod` (full `infra` → `build-and-push` → `deploy` chain) and can be
  triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch` with an `action` input:
  - `plan` — run the `infra` job's `terraform plan` only (no apply, no
    build/deploy).
  - `apply` / `update` — apply Terraform, then build and deploy (these two
    options behave identically since Terraform apply is always
    create-or-update).
  - `destroy` — tears down every resource managed by this state so the
    footprint can be rebuilt from scratch (skips build/deploy).

  The three jobs are:
  1. **`infra`** runs on the on-prem build runner (labels
     `self-hosted, Linux, X64, docker-build`, e.g. `ubuntu-server1`). It runs
     `terraform init`/`validate`/`plan`/`apply` to ensure the footprint exists
     and is up to date. Running Terraform on this persistent runner — rather
     than on the `aws-prod` runner, which *is* the EC2 instance this workflow
     may be creating — avoids that chicken-and-egg problem and lets the
     runner's Terraform plugin cache / working dir persist between runs.
     **Terraform state itself stays remote** in the S3 bucket + DynamoDB lock
     table (see "Terraform" above), so it survives even if the runner host is
     rebuilt.
  2. **`build-and-push`** also runs on the `docker-build` runner. It builds the
     four application images and pushes them to AWS ECR, tagged with the commit
     SHA (immutable) plus `latest`. It authenticates to AWS with the
     `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` secrets (whose IAM user must
     carry the `ecr_push_policy_arn` policy) and self-heals the ECR
     repositories if they don't exist yet. Skipped on the `plan`/`destroy`
     dispatch inputs.
  3. **`deploy`** runs on the self-hosted runner on the EC2 host (label
     `aws-prod`). It logs the host Docker daemon into ECR using the instance
     profile (no static keys), pulls the images just pushed, and runs
     `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d` against RDS/S3.

  Keeping build and deploy in separate jobs keeps the low-powered EC2 host out
  of the image build path (it only pulls and runs). The ECR repositories, the
  EC2 instance role's pull permissions, and the `ecr-push` IAM policy are all
  provisioned by `infra/terraform/aws/ecr.tf`.

### Troubleshooting: `permission denied ... /var/run/docker.sock`

If a build step fails with `permission denied while trying to connect to the
Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`, the self-hosted runner's
user isn't effectively in the `docker` group. This typically happens when the
user was added to the group *after* the runner service started (group changes
don't apply to already-running processes). Both deploy workflows now include an
`Ensure Docker daemon access` preflight step that self-heals this best-effort.
To fix it permanently on the host, add the runner user to the `docker` group and
restart the runner service so it picks up the new group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker <runner-user>
sudo systemctl restart 'actions.runner.*'
```

### Required repository secrets

AWS credentials (used by the `infra` and `build-and-push` jobs of
`infra-prod.yml`):
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — the IAM user behind these must
  additionally have the `ecr-push` policy (`terraform output ecr_push_policy_arn`)
  attached so the `docker-build` runner can push images to ECR.
- `AWS_REGION` — region the ECR registry lives in (e.g. `us-east-2`).
- `TF_VAR_DB_PASSWORD`, `TF_VAR_JWT_SECRET`, `TF_VAR_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `TF_VAR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `TF_VAR_GEMINI_API_KEY`, `TF_VAR_SENTRY_DSN` (optional)
- `RUNNER_REGISTRATION_PAT` — GitHub PAT (repo scope) used by the EC2
  user-data script to mint a short-lived runner registration token

Repository *variables* (not secrets — bucket/table names aren't sensitive),
for the remote state backend created via `infra/terraform/bootstrap`. Add
these under the repo's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions >
Variables** tab (preferred). The `infra` job's backend-check/init steps also
fall back to a same-named repository *secret* if the variable isn't set, so
setting them under the Secrets tab instead works too — but if a value exists
in both places, the Variables value takes precedence.
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET` — S3 bucket name from `terraform output state_bucket`
- `TF_STATE_LOCK_TABLE` — DynamoDB table name from `terraform output lock_table`
- `TF_STATE_REGION` (optional) — region the state bucket/table live in;
  defaults to `us-east-2` if unset

App deploy (for the `deploy` job of `infra-prod.yml`), matching the Terraform outputs:
- `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `RDS_HOST` (= `terraform output db_address`), `RDS_PORT` (usually `5432`)
- `JWT_SECRET`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `S3_UPLOAD_BUCKET` (= `terraform output uploads_bucket`), `S3_UPLOAD_PREFIX`, `AWS_REGION`
- `FRONTEND_URL`, `ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL`, `APP_PORT`, `ADMIN_PORT`, `LANDING_PORT`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SMTP_*`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `SENTRY_DSN` (optional/as applicable)

## Application code changes

`backend/app/utils/file_storage.py` adds a `STORAGE_BACKEND` switch
(`local` default, `s3` for AWS) used by every place the app previously wrote
directly to `UPLOAD_DIR`:

- `app/routers/attachments.py` (generic entity attachments)
- `app/routers/client_portal.py` (client-portal document uploads)
- `app/routers/vendor_portal.py` (vendor invoice / insurance certificate uploads)
- `app/services/document_search_service.py` (RAG/keyword indexing reads)

Local development and the existing `docker-compose.yml` VPS deploy are
unaffected — `STORAGE_BACKEND` defaults to `local`, preserving the previous
on-disk behavior.
